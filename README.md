#### Use NPM scripts

- `npm run build` to build an optimized version of your application in /dist
- `npm run serve` to launch a browser sync server on your source files
- `npm run serve:dist` to launch a server on your optimized application
- `npm run test` to launch your unit tests with Karma
- `npm run test:auto` to launch your unit tests with Karma in watch mode


#### Or Gulp tasks

If you have [`gulp-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-cli) installed in global packages you can use equivalent:

- `gulp` or `gulp build`
- `gulp serve`
- `gulp serve:dist`
- `gulp test`
- `gulp test:auto`

If your CLI version (gulp -v) is not version 4, you will have to run the local gulp version which is V4:

node_modules/.bin/gulp serve
